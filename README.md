 ARVR Class activities
 
**REQUIRES THE VUFORIA PACKAGES, CURRENT VUFORIA PACKAGE USES com.ptc.vuforia.engine-10.12.3.tgz**

Each Activity is in their own scene and folder

Currently Contains
1. Model Switcher - As name suggests
2. Brick Stacker - Tap on target to spawn bricks, falling results in game over
3. Tower Defense - Utilizes Virtual Buttons to make turrets fire
4. "Zombie" Beacon - Another image target (represented as a blue pillar) is used to move within the main image target play area
5. Furniture Placer - Works really badly but it looks like it works ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
6. ~~Promotional Box Art~~ - Couldn't create one cause vuforia won't let me create a multiimage target. Oh well
7. Wrecking Ball - 4 Cubes on a platform. Camera has the wrecking ball and we push off the cubes
